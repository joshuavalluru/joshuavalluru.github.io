## Computer Programming
---
I have experience in building both traditional (SVMs) and deep learning (CNNs) ML models for my projects as a research intern at Stanford, using TensorFlow and scikit-learn frameworks.

I used open APIs (e.g., OpenAuth, Twitter and FB Stream API) and built parsers in Java to collect and model data from different sources into data structures like HashMaps, Dictionaries and Binary Index trees.
I have also built front-end visualization apps in Javascript (web) and Swift (iOS)

Platforms and skills: 
* **AI Platforms:** TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn
* **Languages:** Java, Python
* **Data tools:** NumPy, Plotly
* **Cloud:** Google Cloud, AWS, Github
* **Audio/Video Software:** [Video Editing, Making Multimedia Content, Audio Editing / Enhancement](av.md)

### Predicting Socio Economic Sentiments

Developed a model to predict trends in the economy by training with data from social media posts. This was a great learning experience which exposed me to the domain of Deep Learning, which played a pivotal role in addressing a wide variety of problems that were previously too complex to be solved effectively using simpler models.

### ProPublica Article Summary and Analysis

Predictive machine learning models such as COMPAS (which stands for Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) increasingly assist human experts e.g.,  judges in their day-to-day high stakes decision making. 

It’s quite revealing that even after using “objective” machine based models, we haven’t resolved the issue of societal biases. I realized that it is important to ensure that these models are not biased towards or against specific values of certain attributes such as race and gender. 

The fact that these models are black boxes and the human experts, who are end users, have no access to the actual model or the corresponding training data makes it quite challenging to determine the underlying biases of these models.

### There Will Never Be Another You
This jazz standard by Harry Warren is a popular tune that is called very often at jam sessions. Because it is my favorite tune, I have sought to pay homage to its original arrangement as a jazz ballad. I recorded this tune with Michael Mitchell (drums) and Danny Gerz (bass) in a guitar trio format on October 8, 2019.

### Donna Lee
Miles Davis tunes have always inspired me, and this contrafact over the changes to Back Home in Indiana is both an exciting tune and a harmonically dense piece. I recorded this tune with Michael Mitchell (drums) and Danny Gerz (bass) in a guitar trio format on October 8, 2019.

### Chi Chi
Charlie Parker’s blues heads have long been a subject of discussion, and I have rigorously studied some of his heads like Blues for Alice. Yet at jazz sessions, I am constantly surprised by how rarely played Chi Chi is. I recorded this tune with Michael Mitchell (drums) and Danny Gerz (bass) in a guitar trio format on October 8, 2019.

### Wave
I have chosen this Latin tune by Antonio Carlos Jobim because of its incredible harmony. I recorded this tune with Michael Mitchell (drums) and Danny Gerz (bass) in a guitar trio format on October 8, 2019.

### Deluge
Wayne Shorter’s modern extension of the bebop language has always fascinated me. This rather short tune is unique because of its modal qualities and the interpretive freedom it grants the improviser. I recorded this tune with Michael Mitchell (drums) and Danny Gerz (bass) in a guitar trio format on October 8, 2019.
