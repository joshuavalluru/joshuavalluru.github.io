### Wave
I have chosen this Latin tune by Antonio Carlos Jobim because of its incredible harmony. I have recorded this tune with Michael Mitchell (drums) and Danny Gerz (Bass) in a guitar trio format on October 8, 2019.

### Deluge
Wayne Shorter’s modern extension of the bebop language has always fascinated me. This 8 Bar song is unique because of its modal qualities and the interpretive freedom it grants the improviser. I have recorded this tune with Michael Mitchell (drums) and Danny Gerz (Bass) in a guitar trio format on October 8, 2019.

### There Will Never Be Another You
This jazz standard by Harry Warren is a popular tune that is called very often at jam sessions. Because it is my favorite tune, I have sought to pay homage to its original arrangement as a jazz ballad. I have recorded this tune with Michael Mitchell (drums) and Danny Gerz (Bass) in a guitar trio format on October 8, 2019.

### Donna Lee
Miles Davis tunes have always inspired me, and this contrafact over the changes to Back Home in Indiana is both an exciting tune and harmonically dense piece. I have recorded this tune with Michael Mitchell (drums) and Danny Gerz (Bass) in a guitar trio format on October 8, 2019.

### Chi Chi
Charlie Parker’s blues heads have long been a subject of discussion, and I have rigorously studied some of his heads like Blues for Alice. Yet at jazz sessions, I am constantly surprised by how rarely played this blues head is. I have recorded this tune with Michael Mitchell (drums) and Danny Gerz (Bass) in a guitar trio format on October 8, 2019.

## Computer Programming Background
---
I have experience in building both traditional (SVMs) and deep learning (CNNs) ML models for my projects as a research intern at Stanford, using TensorFlow and scikit-learn frameworks.

I used open APIs (e.g., OpenAuth, Twitter and FB Stream API) and built parsers in Java to collect and model data from different sources into data structures like HashMaps, Dictionaries and Binary Index trees.
I have also built front-end visualization apps in Javascript (web) and Swift (iOS)

Platforms and skills: 
* **AI Platforms:** TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn
* **Languages:** Java, Python
* **Data tools:** NumPy, Plotly
* **Cloud:** Google Cloud, AWS, Github

### Predicting Socio Economic Sentiments

Developed a model to predict trends in the economy by training with data from social media posts. This was a great learning experience which exposed me to the domain of Deep Learning, which played a pivotal role in addressing a wide variety of problems that were previously too complex to be solved effectively using simpler models.

### ProPublica Article Summary and Analysis

Predictive machine learning models such as COMPAS (which stands for Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) increasingly assist human experts e.g.,  judges in their day-to-day high stakes decision making. 

It’s quite revealing that even after using “objective” machine based models, we haven’t resolved the issue of societal biases. I realized that it is important to ensure that these models are not biased towards or against specific values of certain attributes such as race and gender. 

The fact that these models are black boxes and the human experts, who are end users, have no access to the actual model or the corresponding training data makes it quite challenging to determine the underlying biases of these models.

## Audio/Video Software Tools/Applications

### Video Editing
 
For most of the video editing requirements I use FFMPEG which is an open source video manipulation software. FFMPEG has a powerful command-line interface for controlling and manipulating almost all the parameters of a video. I mainly use it for cropping, transcoding and mixing videos. 
 
Uncompressed video is quite large for streaming on internet so video is always compressed with codecs like H.264. The more a video is compressed, the smaller size (bytes) it uses while compromising on video quality. Once a video is ready for streaming, I encode it into multiple quality streams - low, medium, high for instance - to be used for clients of different network (bandwidth) conditions. I do it by manipulating resolution, framerate and bitrate parameters in FFMpeg.


### Making Multimedia Content

For advanced creation of multimedia content, I use iMovie. It was a rich UI for splitting and combining audio/video streams within a video file. It allows me to combine videos, change audio streams (for instance, adding a background audio) with a simple UI and visualize the video before publishing it .


### Audio Editing / Enhancement
 
I extract the audio stream from the video first using FFMpeg and then use Audacity, which is another open source audio editing tool for enhancing and combining audio streams. It allows me to do things like de-noising, adjusting the gain,  speech enhancement etc. Once the audio stream is ready, I can put it back into the video using iMovie or FFmpeg.
